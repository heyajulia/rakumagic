# Raku Magic

This is the repository of Raku Programming Language code snippets to be tweeted by [@rakumagic](https://twitter.com/rakumagic).  The idea is to show off fun pieces of code, or just code that shows some feature of the Raku Programming Language that you've encountered, like and would like to have more people know about.

Just [add an issue](https://github.com/heyajulia/rakumagic/issues/new?assignees=heyajulia&labels=new&template=new-snippet.md&title=) with your code snippet, and at some point your snippet will be tweeted using the [#rakulang tag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rakulang&src=typed_query&f=live).

Let us know what you like about the Raku Programming Language in code, so that we can get more people to know about it, and hopefully like it too!
